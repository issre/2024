                Rate discounting is offered for IEEE or CCF members and for Students. Special discounted rates are

                Each paper included in the proceedings must be covered by an <span class="fw-bold">author registration</span>, which can have
                IEEE/CCF discount but not student discount. Author registrations must be completed within the
                term of early registration. Non-authors and co-authors of papers already covered are allowed a
                reduced rate. The same registration cannot cover multiple papers.

            <p>
                Papers presented in the research track or in the industry track must be covered by a full conference
                registration. Papers presented in workshops, in the doctoral symposium, in the fast abstract track, or
                in the journal first track, can be covered by a single day registration.

            <p>
                A full conference registration covers both a paper presented in the research or industry track AND a paper presented in workshops, or doctoral symposium, or fast abstract track, or journal first track. 
                Please contact the registration chair to obtain the code that enables the discount on the additional paper registration.
