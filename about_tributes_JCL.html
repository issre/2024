                    <p class="rtejustify">It is with profound sadness that we bring you the news of Jean-Claude Laprie passing away due to cancer on Sunday, October 17th, 2010 in Toulouse, France. Only a couple months ago he was making plans to be with us in San Jose at ISSRE
                        2010.
                    </p>
                    <p class="rtejustify">Jean-Claude has a been a strong voice in our community, helping shape and grow the area as technology changed and software reliability took a more central place in the area of dependability. He was one of the invited speakers at the
                        very first ISSRE in 1990 and has since worked closely with the organization and serving on our advisory council. Jean-Claude was one of the engines in the "Dependability" and Fault tolerant computing communities which is closely
                        related to Software Reliability.</p>
                    <p class="rtejustify">Jean-Claude was selected to receive the IEEE Distinguished Service Award for his service to the Software Reliability Community this year at ISSRE 2010. But soon we learned that his travels were less than likely Karama Kanoun was requested
                        to communicate the news to Jean-Claude and his wife Anne Marie, should a situation arise due to failing health. They decided to inform him on Friday when he was still in good condition. We heard that he was very happy to receive
                        the news.</p>
                    <p class="rtejustify">Here are a couple pictures of Jean-Claude from 2009. The first one (left) is at the program committee dinner at Raleigh, NC in July and the other (right) when the steering committee awarded Infosys an award at ISSRE 2009 in Mysuru
                        India.
