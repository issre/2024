            <h1 class="page-header">Call for Papers - Industry Track</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3>

            <p> The objective of the ISSRE Industry Track is to establish an effective dialogue between software practitioners and software engineering researchers concerning the challenges, findings (both positive and negative), encountered obstacles, and lessons learned related to software reliability. Of particular interest is information on applying novel software development, verification, and validation practices in diverse lifecycle styles, industry sectors, and software types. The 34th edition of ISSRE will be an in-person event taking place in Florence, Italy. All presenters of accepted papers will be required to attend the conference physically in Florence. However, we plan to allow the attendance of the conference also online. </p>

            <p><span class="fw-bold"> We aim to encourage wide industry participation.</span></p>

            <p> In recent years, the ISSRE industry program has expanded and has covered a wide range of topics, including cloud computing, agile development, mobile communications, defect prediction/detection/fixing, release management, defect classification, rejuvenation, security, customer experience/satisfaction, availability, social network analysis, big data analysis, and specific reliability concerns of the transportation, aviation, healthcare, telecom, and other industry sectors. </p>


            <p> Industry Track papers will address the application of software engineering practices (which may include work on principles, techniques, tools, methods, or processes) to a specific domain or to the development of a substantial software system. We expect Industry Track papers to be of interest to software development professionals, as well as to software reliability and software quality and process improvement groups with concrete relation to industrial problems and applications. </p>

            <h3><strong> Topics of Interest </strong></h3>

            <p> Topics of interest include development, analysis methods and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability. </li>

                <li> Reliability threats, i.e., faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures </li>

            <h3><strong> Submission guidelines and instructions </strong></h3>

            <p> There are two different alternatives for ISSRE Industry Track submissions: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Full paper submission consisting of 6 pages (including references). </li>

                <li> Short paper submission consisting of 2 pages (including references). </li>

            </ul>

            <p> All the submissions will be reviewed by members of the Industry Track Program Committee. Accepted papers will be included in the ISSRE Supplemental Proceedings and submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore.
            </p>


            <p> Submissions must adhere to the <a class="link-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines</a> as implemented by the following LaTeX/Word templates:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a class="link-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/conference-latex-template_10-17-19.zip">LaTex Package</a> (ZIP)</li>
                <li><a class="link-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-a4.docx">Word Template</a> (DOCX)</li>
            </ul>


            <p> Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of success. Please take a note of the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Submissions should not be anonymous. </li>

                <li> Please consider that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers. Thus, describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them. </li>

                <li> The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (i.e., it has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. </li>

                <li> Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. </li>

                <li>Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB. </li>
            </ul>


            <p> A paper must include the title, the name and affiliation of each author, an abstract of up to 150 words, and up to 4 keywords. Papers that exceed the page limits specified, are outside the scope of the symposium, or do not follow the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review. </p>

            <p> Authors of accepted papers will have the chance to present their work at the ISSRE 2023 conference. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register for the conference and to give the talk, either in person or remotely, if the paper is accepted. </p>


            <h3><strong>Best Paper Awards</strong></h3>

            <p> This yearâ€™s edition of the ISSRE Industry Track will include two best paper awards: </p>

            <div style="padding-left: 1.2em;">
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Best Practice Paper Award</span></p>
                <p> This category will award the best among the full papers accepted to appear in the ISSRE 2023 Industry Track. All full papers accepted to the Industry Track will be eligible for this award. </p>


                <p><span class="fw-bold">Best Disruptive Paper Award</span></p>
                <p> This category will award the most disruptive idea accepted to appear in the ISSRE 2023 Industry Track. ALL papers (short and regular papers) accepted to the Industry Track will be eligible. Candidates for this award are those papers describing and motivating wild, novel, or disruptive ideas that will address problems at the cutting edge of industry. </p>
            </div>

            <p> A special industry committee including specialists from different areas will propose 2 to 3 candidates for each award. The final selection for the Best Practice Paper Award will be done by the audience attending the presentation of the candidate papers. The Best Disruptive Paper Award will be awarded directly by the Industry Track PC. </p>
