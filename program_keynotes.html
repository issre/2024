                        Recent rapid advancements in AI technologies pose significant challenges for quality assurance (QA) of systems employing these technologies due to the opaque nature of their internal workings. 
                        This talk will discuss various challenges to QA for AI-based systems and how they are being addressed. 
                        We will argue that these challenges have some parallels in other disciplines such as engineering and social sciences, 
                        and that radically multi-disciplinary discussions are needed.
