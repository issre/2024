                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">
                        Software regression testing aims at ensuring that introduced changes do not cause previously passing tests to fail. 
                        Testing consumes a great part of software development and maintenance effort, and regression testing is by far the most 
                        expensive among testing activities. Along three decades, research has proposed many techniques that address the cost-effective
                         software regression testing along different dimensions, including, among others, prioritization, minimization, selection,
                         and amplification techniques. Notwithstanding, the problem remains prominent, even more by considering continuous integration
                        practices that promote frequent change commits and retesting. In our work we point to two issues in current research on software
                        regression testing: it is fragmented, in that the large part of proposed approaches only address one problem dimension at a time,
                        and it often relies on unrealistic assumptions that make most proposed solutions hardly applicable. We addressed the latter issue
                        in a recent systematic review of literature, complemented with a survey of professional testers. As a result of such an effort,
                        we share a live open repository of current techniques and tools. To address the former issue, we introduced the notion of
                        regression test orchestration, which consists of combining different techniques into one synergic strategy.
                        Some initial studies (unsurprisingly) confirm that approaching regression testing by using properly combined techniques can often
                        provide more efficient and effective solutions. Indeed, to identify the most effective orchestration strategies we need to perform
                        empirical studies that compare and combine the many existing techniques. We invite the community to the conduction of more similar
                        studies. For the future in this keynote we also hint at a regression test orchestration framework that ideally can autonomously
                        manage itself by continuously monitoring the testing process and by proposing an optimized test campaign via the embedding of
                        suitable heuristics and learning approaches. Such an autonomic test orchestrator would alleviate testers from the effort-demanding
                        regression testing practices, allowing them to better spend their energy into other tasks requiring human attention.

                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">Software-controlled autonomous systems are
                        developed at a fast pace for use in healthcare, transportation, manufacturing and many other application domains.
                        Often comprising machine learning components, these systems are expected to perform tasks and make decisions
                        without human intervention for extended periods of time. As such, they have the potential to undertake or support
                        complex missions that are dangerous, difficult or tedious for humans. To achieve this potential, autonomous systems
                        must operate resiliently in open real-world environments. This talk will present recent advances in probabilistic
                        and parametric model checking, and their applications to engineering autonomous systems capable of providing their
                        required functionality despite operating in the presence of uncertainty, change, faults, failure and other
                        disruptions.

                    <p class="rtejustify"><span class="fw-bold">Abstract:</span>&nbsp;<span class="fst-italic">Edge computing has rapidly grown in recent years as
                        a paradigm to facilitate the delivery of lowlatency and mission-critical applications in areas such as autonomous
                        driving, smart agriculture, augmented reality, and industrial automation. Despite its popularity and prospects,
                        the reliability mechanisms that underpin edge services are still challenging to engineer due to the inherent
                        limitations of the resources on which they run. For example, computational constraints at the edge and latency
                        requirements of the application pose a hurdle to the complexity of techniques that can be used to estimate the
                        state of the system, forecast future dynamics, or select actions for remediation. Hence, reliability engineering
                        is faced with difficult trade-offs between the complexity of runtime analysis and the accuracy of the decision
                        making. In this talk, I will discuss this problem and how recent advances in deep learning, generative models,
                        and co-simulation provide promising solutions, thus offering new building blocks to develop reliable edge
                        computing services.
