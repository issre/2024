            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p> The ISSRE 2024 Doctoral Symposium is intended to bring together PhD students working on
                innovative research for improving, monitoring, and assessing the reliability, dependability, and
                security of software systems, and give them the opportunity to present and discuss their research in
                a constructive, friendly, and international atmosphere.
                The goals of the Doctoral Symposium are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing a setting for constructive feedback on participants&#39; current research and guidance on future research directions;</li>
                <li>Developing a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research;</li>
                <li>Providing an opportunity for PhD students to interact with established researchers and practitioners in the software reliability engineering community.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                The authors of the selected papers will present their work and receive feedback both from a panel of experts from academia and industry and from other Doctoral Symposium students. 
                The students will also have the opportunity to seek advice on various aspects of completing a PhD, such as how to perform research, how to design and execute empirical research, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The papers accepted and presented at the Doctoral Symposium will be published in the supplementary conference proceedings of ISSRE 2024.
            </p>
