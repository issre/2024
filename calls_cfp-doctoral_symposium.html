            <h1 class="page-header">Call for Papers - Doctoral Symposium 2023</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Doctoral Symposium will take place on October 9th, 2023, the day before the IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2023).
            </p>

            <strong><b>IMPORTANT: Doctoral Students presenting at the Doctoral Symposium have a discounted fee. Also, further discounts are possible to students who volunteer to serve as staff during the conference (limited to availability).</b></strong>

            <h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3>

            <p> The ISSRE 2023 Doctoral Symposium is intended to bring together PhD students working on
                innovative research for improving, monitoring, and assessing the reliability, dependability, and
                security of software systems, and give them the opportunity to present and discuss their research in
                a constructive, friendly, and international atmosphere.
                The goals of the Doctoral Symposium are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>provide a setting for constructive feedback on participants&#39; current research and guidance on future research directions;</li>
                <li>develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research;</li>
                <li>provide an opportunity for student participants to interact with established researchers and practitioners in the software reliability engineering community.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Selected students will present their work and receive feedback both from a panel of experts from academia and industry, and from other Doctoral Symposium students. 
                The students will also have the opportunity to seek advice on various aspects of completing a PhD, such as how to perform research, how to design and execute empirical research, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The papers accepted and presented at the Doctoral Symposium will be published in the supplementary conference proceedings of ISSRE 2023.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Who should participate</strong></h3>

            <p>
                Students at all stages (at the beginning, at the middle, or near the end of their PhD) who are working
