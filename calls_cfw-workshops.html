            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>

            <p> ISSRE strives to be the conference that appeals to both researchers and practitioners. To that end, we invite proposals for workshops to co-locate with the Symposium and provide additional opportunities for collaborating and exchanging information. The workshops aim at discussing research developments and challenges at an early stage. ISSRE welcomes workshops that explore new ways to provide and assess software reliability, safety, and security. We also seek workshops that deal with the provision of reliable, safe, and secure software and systems in fast-growing, transformative application domains. Appropriately defined workshop proposals have the following characteristics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>They offer researchers a forum to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas at an early stage before maturation that would warrant conference or journal publication;</li>

                <li> They attract practitioners and researchers to working sessions to discuss and make progress toward solutions to current and future problems in engineering high assurance software and systems; </li>

                <li>They focus on collaborative discussions and information sharing between researchers and industry practitioners. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Recurring Workshops</strong></h3>

            <p> Workshops affiliated with ISSRE in previous years with good organization and numbers of participants are pre-approved. Their organizers do not need to submit a new workshop proposal. Their organizers are kindly asked to inform the workshop chairs about returning the workshop to ISSRE in 2024. The whole ISSRE 2024 Organizing Committee will check the workshops' previous records and vote to decide.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Topics of Interest</strong></h3>

            <p>Topics of interest include development, analysis methods and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Primary dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability) impacting software reliability </li>

                <li>Secondary dependability attributes (i.e., survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability </li>

                <li>Reliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures </li>
