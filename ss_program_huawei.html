            <p>Bio: Dr. Zhenli Sheng joined Huawei in 2015 after completing his Ph.D.
                He currently serves as the Director of the Cloud Availability Engineering Lab, 
                where he leads efforts in technical innovation and the application of reliability 
                and availability solutions for Huawei Cloud. Dr. Sheng has authored over 10 papers 
                in top-tier journals and holds approximately 15 patents.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #336699;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
            <p>Huawei Cloud is one of the leading global providers in cloud computing, offering around 200 services and operating nearly one million servers.
                Throughout our journey, we've faced various reliability challenges related to both hardware and software, some of which have become particularly critical in the AI era. 
                In this talk, we will explore the key reliability issues in AI clusters and share how we address these risks through hardware fault prediction, silent data corruption detection, 
                and resilient recovery during large language model (LLM) training. Finally, we will highlight some of the remaining challenges that continue to demand attention.</p>
