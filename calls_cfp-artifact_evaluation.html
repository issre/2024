                Each submitted artifact will undergo review by at least three members of the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). 
            </p>
            <p> Before submitting your artifact, please review the information below. 
                If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the AEC chairs.
            </p>

            <h3><strong >Understanding Artifacts </strong></h3>

            <p> Artifacts encompass digital entities pivotal to research, spanning code or data, whether crafted by authors to bolster their investigations or generated throughout experiments. 
                The AE process advocates for the transparent sharing of these artifacts, fostering open science principles and bolstering research reproducibility. 
                Within the realm of software reliability, artifacts may encompass tools, data (such as logs or raw data), or a fusion of both. 
                For instance, an Artifact Evaluation Package might comprise an executable tool alongside sample data to showcase its functionality. 
                Note that, while you are encouraged to release the source code of your tools, you can also just release the executable binaries. 
                Should you have any uncertainties regarding the eligibility of your artifact for the AE process, feel free to reach out to the AE Chairs for further guidance. 
            </p>

            <h3><strong> Objectives of Evaluation and Badge Certification </strong></h3>

            <p> Aligned with IEEE standards, artifacts evaluation pursues three primary objectives:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li> 
                    <span class="fw-bold">Available Badge: </span> The code and/or datasets, along with any associated data and documentation provided by the authors, should be reasonable and complete. They should have the potential to support reproducibility of the published results. 
                </li>

                <li> <span class="fw-bold">Reviewed Badge: </span> The code and/or datasets, along with any associated data and documentation provided by the authors, should be reasonable, complete, and capable of producing the outputs described in the paper. It should also support reproducibility of the published results.
                </li>

                <li> <span class="fw-bold">Reproducible Badge: </span> This badge signifies an additional level of certification. It indicates that an independent party has successfully regenerated computational results using the research objects, methods, code, and analysis conditions created by the authors. 
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p> To earn the Reviewed badge, authors must also obtain the Available badge. 
                Similarly, to earn the Reproducible badge, authors must obtain both the Reviewed and Available badges. 
                Further details will be provided in the subsequent information.
            </p>
            
            <h3><strong> How to Prepare and Submit an Artifact? </strong></h3>

            <p>
            Your artifact should contain a README file, preferably with a .txt, .md, or .html extension. The README file should include four sections:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> <span class="fw-bold">Artifact Description:</span> Explain the content of the artifact, detailing the structure of folders, files, and any other relevant information.
                </li>

                <li> <span class="fw-bold">Environment Setup: </span> Specify the requirements to run the artifact, including operating system, minimum RAM, or CPU. We strongly recommend providing a Docker image for ease of access. In such a case, you also need to provide the information on how to run the Docker image.
                </li>

                <li> <span class="fw-bold">Getting Started: </span> Describe how to set up the artifact and validate its general functionality based on a small example data. This setup and execution should ideally take no more than 30 minutes.
                </li>

                <li> <span class="fw-bold">Reproducibility Instructions: </span> Describes how to reproduce the paperâ€™s claims and results in detail. 
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p> The inclusion of all sections depends on the type of artifact you are submitting and the badges you are requesting for review. </p>

            <p> Specifically: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Artifact Description and Environment Setup sections are required for the Available, Reviewed, and Reproducible badges. </li>
                <li> The Getting Started section is required for the Reviewed and Reproducible badges. </li>
                <li> The Reproducibility Instructions section is required for the Reproducible badge. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> To qualify for 'Available' or higher badges, you must include a LICENSE file that contains an open-source license, which clearly describes the distribution rights for your project. 
            </p>

            <p> Once you have prepared your artifact, including both the required README file and LICENSE file, upload it to Zenodo or a similar service (e.g., figshare) to acquire a DOI. This DOI should be included in both the camera-ready version of your paper and during the artifact submission.
            </p>

            <p> To submit the artifact for evaluation, provide the DOI and additional information about the artifact (e.g., the paper abstract) using the EasyChair platform. You also need to provide a copy of the accepted paper and specify which of the badges you are applying for. </p>

            <p> More information about the badges and the best artifact awards follows. </p>

            <h3><strong> Available Badge </strong></h3>

            <p> To qualify for the Available badge, your artifact must be accessible through a hosting platform. While Zenodo is commonly used and recommended for its reliability and integration with scholarly practices, authors are free to choose the platform that best suits their needs. Ensure that your artifact is self-contained and versioned during the upload process. Upon upload to your chosen platform, a DOI will be generated, which is essential for artifact evaluation submission.
            </p>

            <p> Kindly note that once submitted, your artifact will be immediately accessible to the public and cannot be modified or deleted. However, you retain the option to upload an updated version, which will be assigned a new DOI (e.g., to address reviewer feedback).
            </p>

            <p> Furthermore, please ensure that your artifact is accompanied by a LICENSE file, clearly outlining the distribution rights. To be eligible for badges such as 'Available' or higher, the file must incorporate an open-source license.
            </p>

            <p> Reviewers will validate the authenticity of the DOI and LICENSE file, and then assess the clarity and comprehensiveness of your artifact and README file.
            </p>

            <h3><strong> Reviewed Badge </strong></h3>

            <p> Reviewers will evaluate your artifact's fundamental functionality based on the instructions provided in the "Getting Started" section of the README file. The Reviewed Badge will be awarded if reviewers can successfully set up the artifact and verify its basic functionality using a small sample dataset within 30 minutes.
            </p>

            <h3><strong> Reproducible Badge </strong></h3>

            <p> Earning the Reproducible badge entails an additional level of scrutiny. Reviewers will reproduce computational results using your research objects, methods, code, and analysis conditions. Therefore, the inclusion of a Reproducibility Instructions section is imperative for this badge. Reviewers will conduct a thorough assessment to validate your artifact's support for the paper's primary claims.
            </p>

            <p> Please note that if reproducing results requires extensive computation or substantial computational resources, reviewers may exercise discretion in running experiments. If obtaining results necessitates significant computation time (e.g., days or months), reviewers may not be able to reproduce them fully.
            </p>
            
            <p> It is crucial to emphasize that clear, detailed documentation and instructions are essential for badge certification.
            </p>
            
            <p> Should you require further clarification or assistance, please feel free to contact the AEC Chairs.
            </p>
