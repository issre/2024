            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>ISSRE 2023 will continue running the “Journal First Conference Second” track that seeks to include journal papers in the ISSRE 2023 program. The authors of papers published recently in prestigious software reliability engineering journals are invited to send a proposal to present their work at ISSRE 2023. Note that the submitted J1C2 paper shall not be a former workshop or conference paper. Via this scheme authors have the possibility to present their work to a wider audience in person, discuss, network with peers, and drive renewed interest to their work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ISSRE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program. At least one author of each presentation accepted for the journal-first program must register and attend the conference to present the paper at the time identified in the program.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Scope</strong></h3>

            <p> A journal-first presentation submitted to ISSRE 2023 must adhere to the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The paper was accepted for publication not earlier than January 1st 2022</li>
                <li>The paper is in the scope of the conference, as defined in the call for ISSRE 2023 research papers</li>
                <li>The paper reports completely new research results or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not reported in prior work</li>
                <li>The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Submission of Proposals</strong></h3>
            
            <p>
                Authors of manuscripts that respect these criteria are invited to send a one-page presentation proposal (in IEEE 2-column format) via this submission link on EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre23, consisting of the paper's title, the paper's authors, the paper’s abstract, a description of how the paper fits into the conference theme, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal's Web site. If the paper is not online yet, then specify so. Authors will also have to upload a copy of the paper.
            </p>

            <p>
                Authors will be invited to present their paper at ISSRE 2023 after a check that the paper is in scope for the conference and it adheres to the criteria above. The papers will not be reviewed again for technical content. In case an exceptionally high number of proposals is received, presentation proposals will be prioritized according to their fit to the conference theme and structure of sessions. The PC Chairs will notify the authors about their decision.
            </p>
